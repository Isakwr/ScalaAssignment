// Puzzle.pseudocode

// define a structure for the puzzle, including the grid, size, row clues, and column clues
Puzzle:
  Fields:
    size: tuple of two integers (width, height)
    grid: 2D array of characters representing the puzzle grid
    rowClues: list of integers representing the clues for each row
    columnClues: list of integers representing the clues for each column

// provide a method to solve the puzzle by filling empty squares with random numbers
Puzzle.solve(puzzle):
  initialize random number generator
  create new grid by iterating over each row in puzzle.grid:
    for each cell in the row:
      if cell is empty ('_'):
        replace with a random number between 1 and puzzle.width
      otherwise, leave the cell unchanged
  return Solution with the new grid

// define a structure for the solution, which includes the solved grid
Solution:
  Fields:
    grid: 2D array of characters representing the solved puzzle grid

  method to convert the solution grid into a string for output
  Solution.toString():
    convert each row of grid to a string
    combine all rows into a single string with newline separators
